Do not break the atmosphere.

Do not metagame.</strong>

<strong>This is an atmospheric and immersive roleplay server in the dark setting of 40k. Set from the perspective of a Rogue Trader on a newly founded colony on the fringe of space. Outside of imperial borders and direct control, surrounded by aliens and heretics, and amongst the remains of a civilization born in the dark ages of humanity's distant past. You are to aid (or hinder) this expedition and it's attempts to bring order and exploitation, while dealing with factionalism and politics amongst the ever suspicious Inquisition, the zealots of the Ecclesiarchy, and the dogmatic Priests of the Machine Cult.

You have recently arrived or have been contained for a time within the ice world of Beroghast, bastioned within the noble frontier systems of the Eminent Domain. Finding yourselves in the presence of servants sent by Holy Terra herself. Most unaware of the desanctification of the fortress, the rot of chaos festering within the underdark and the horror that has claimed all those who came before them.
